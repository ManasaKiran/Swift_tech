This is the code to find fibanocci series 
The priority level goes as shown below :
1. divisible by 15 
2. divisble by 5 or 3 
3. A prime number
4. None of the above 

Note :
0 and 1 are not considered for any of the tests

Implementation :

1. Based on the user input , dynamically memory is allocated of n array
2. Not implimented recursive function as it may lead to stack overflow if the number is huge
3. The code is implimented in terms of functions as it will easy to implent other functions 
4. fab which calucaltes fab series and is_prime finds the prime number
